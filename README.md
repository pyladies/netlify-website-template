# netlify-website-template

Example of PyLadies Website theme powered by Netlify with [a standard pull request template](github.com/pyladies/netlify-website-template/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE). You can preview the template [here](https://netlify-template-simple.netlify.app).

## What is Netlify?

Netlify is a simple tool to use for continuous integration and continuous development (CI/CD). It allows you to specify custom build commands as well as run checks in your pull requests. You can additionally get a deploy preview of your website capturing the changes generated in a pull request on a Netlify hosted url. Here's [an example pull request](https://github.com/pyladies/netlify-website-template/pull/1) to see the checks and deploy.

## Setting up you website with Netlify

1. Fork the repo.
2. This repo has `gh-pages` set as the [default branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch).
3. Register for a Netlify account. [Open source teams qualify for free OSS accounts](https://www.netlify.com/legal/open-source-policy/), use your `pyladies` chapter email address when creating your account. You'll need to host a Netlify badge on your website which is already included in the emplate. Please note that any overages will be additionally charged.
4. Setup your site with [these directions](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/). As this is a simple html and css website there is no need for custom build steps.
5. If you have requested a [custom domain](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies/README.md) you can configure that within [your Netlify site](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/26/how-to-set-up-netlify-dns-custom-domains-cname-a-records/).

## Template Information

- Main file you'll update is `index.html` where you can add organizer information, your own chapter branding, contact links for your chapter, and replace the skyline image.
- You'll want to place organizer photos can be placed in the `images/bios` directory and update the `images/skyline.jpg` with your own desired skyline image.
- If you have past organizers you'll want to replace photos and update infos, if not remove the section.
- If you rename the skyline image modify the `style.css` to point it to the image, look for the `.skyline` css rule.
- Add your custom `@pyladies/chapter-organizer` team that is created when you add your website to the [PyLadies Chapter Website repo](github.com/pyladies/chapter-websites) e.g. `@pyladies/chicago`
- If you have a twitter account you can get the timeline widget from [publish twitter](https://publish.twitter.com/). Replace the link in `index.html`, in the event section, with the one you get in the timeline code generated by twitter, and uncomment the section.
- For the events section you can add photos from you events. 2 photos and the twitter timeline work well together.

## Local Development

If you'd like to see your changes locally you can use `Python3` to serve up the content by:

```bash
$ cd /root-of-forked-directory
$ python -m http.server # Defaults to port 8000, you can change by providing an additional integer for the desired port
```

## Option: Hosting your website on GitHub pages

GitHub provides a free hosted page for each [GitHub user](https://pages.github.com/). You can setup your page either via:

1. Using and creating a repo `github_username.github.io`.
2. Using `gh-pages` branch, which is the default branch on this template.

You can look at your repository > settings > GitHub Pages for more information on generating the `CNAME` file if you have a custom domain.
